# web-scraper

A simple scraper for static web pages.

## Notes

* The file `dynamicScraper.js` is a sample scraper for dynamic web pages, it uses the puppeteer as a headless browser.
* Checkout [Nightmare](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare) for an alternative headless browser.
* Headless browsers can generate annoying on automated tests that can be fixes by just running the same test again.
* Checkout [Nightwatch](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch) for Automated end-to-end testing.
